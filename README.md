# My Calendar

My project is a calendar that has been built using JavaScript and implemented in HTML with CSS. This calendar allows users to view the current month and navigate to different months.

## Requirements

To use this calendar, you will need the following:

1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for installing dependencies and running scripts.
2. [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for running the development server and building the project.

You can check if you have the required dependencies installed by running npm -v, yarn -v, and node -v in a terminal.

To install npm, follow the instructions on the [npm website](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started). To install yarn, follow the instructions on the [yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). To install node, follow the instructions on the [node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


## Installation

To install and use this project, follow these steps:

1. To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
  git clone git@github.com:0m3re/mycalendar.git
  Alternatively, you can download and extract the zip file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/0m3re/mycalendar) page.
2. Run npm run install or yarn run install to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Run npm run start or yarn run start to start the development server.
4. Open http://localhost:1234 in a web browser to view the calendar.

Alternatively, you can build the project for production by running npm run build or yarn build. This will create a production-ready build of the project in the dist directory. You can then serve the built files using a static file server, such as serve or http-server.

## Usage

To use the calendar, follow these steps:

1. To navigate between different months, use the left and right arrows at the top of the calendar or the right and left arrow keys.
